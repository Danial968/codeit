That is, the order of the units is changed (the plaintext is reordered). Mathematically a bijective function is used on the characters' positions to encrypt and an inverse function to decrypt."}, {'n': 8, 'text': 'Alice wants to send a message to Bob, but she is worried that her messages are being monitored by a third-party. To make sure that they can exchange messages securely, Alice and Bob created a simple transposition encryption algorithm which shuffles the message they are sending into a meaningless sequence of characters. The recipient can then recover the original message by always taking every n-th character of the encrypted message, starting from the first character. More specifically, after taking the first letter of the ciphertext, the next (n-1) letters are skipped and the next letter is taken. This step is repeated until the end of the message is reached, after which the same procedure is repeated starting from the second letter of the ciphertext. This continues until all letters are used. In this challenge, you will implement the encryption algorithm for this ciper. For a given message, produce the encrypted text (ciphertext). To make the cipher a little bit stronger, you should convert all letters to uppercase and leave out all spaces and non-alphanumeric characters.'}, {'n': 10, 'text': 'Alphanumeric, also referred to as alphameric, is a term that encompasses all of the letters and numerals in a given language set. In layouts designed for English language users, alphanumeric characters are those comprised of the combined set of the 26 alphabetic characters, A to Z, and the 10 Arabic numerals, 0 to 9. For some computer purposes, such as file naming, alphanumeric characters are strictly limited to the 26 alphabetic characters and 10 numerals. However, for other applications, such as programming, other keyboard symbols are sometimes permitted. In some usages, the alphanumeric character set may include both upper and lower case letters, punctuation marks and symbols (such as @, &, and *, for example).'}, {'n': 12, 'text': 'Email encryption software products are a specialized security technology for protecting the confidentiality and integrity of email messages and attachments while in transit or in storage. Although the technology has been around for decades, the tools available have made the usability of email encryption better than ever before. Email encryption software attempts to thwart risks posed by network eavesdroppers. By default, email is generally unprotected by protocols such as SSL/TLS, and it is transmitted in plain text across local networks and the Internet. As a result, the contents of email messages, as well as their attachments, can be intercepted and read by an attacker en route between sender and recipient (to say nothing of archived email stored on a server). This creates obvious problems when sensitive data is sent via email, even just between two users within the same organization. All it takes is for one host to be infected with malware to allow for the interception of email messages and the exfiltration of sensitive information. In response to these risks, organizations deploy email encryption software to encrypt every sensitive email message and attachment (and in some cases, every single email, period) before sending them. The recipient is then responsible for decrypting the messages and attachments.'}, {'n': 14, 'text': "When you try your best but you don't succeed. When you get what you want but not what you need.

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry\'s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.Where does it come from?Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum,"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..",comes from a line in section 1.10.32. The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H.Rackham.'}]
